# npmPkgs

Works similarly to nodePackages in nixpkgs, and is used to add packages that are not available from there.

To add more packages, add them to node-packages.json, and run `./generate.sh`. Refer to https://github.com/svanderburg/node2nix#deploying-a-collection-of-npm-packages-from-the-npm-registry for documentation on how it works.
